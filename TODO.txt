The following features needs implementation

[Crawler]
1. Use the same session for each crawling thread.
2. [DONE] Record response time.

[Monitor]
1. Integrate email feature
2. Dynamically add to ignore lists
3. Run as a daemon

[Web Application]
1. Write a web frontend to this program. This is a long term plan. Django is one of the choices. But MEAN stack is also
   a possible choice. Although personally I am more in favor of Python.

[Messages]
1. Send Slack message part needs to be refactored. Sometimes a large volume of error messages occurs, we should limit
   the amount of Slack messages to be sent. We can employ a exponential back-off strategy. See the following link for
   more details (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff)
2. The Slack message structure should be refactored to accommodate more general message contents and format.
